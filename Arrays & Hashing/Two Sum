/*There are two common ways to solve this problem:

1. Brute force, we could iterate through our array and check if the current index and any other number adds to be the 
target. This would lead to a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1) since no additional space is needed.

2. We could create a HashMap which will map each value to the index. We can then iterate through our array, at any given index
there is only one number that when added to the number at our index will lead to the target number. We can solve for that number
and then check if it exists in our HashMap. This will lead to a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity also O(n).*/
