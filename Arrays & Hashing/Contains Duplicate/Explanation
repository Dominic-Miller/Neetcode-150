There are 3 common ways to solve this problem:

1. Brute force, this would be iterating through the array and checking each element to see if there is any other element that is equal to it. 
This is the worst option since it would create a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1) since there is no additional space needed.

2. Sort the array and then iterate through the array and check if the next element is equal to itself. This is a pretty good solution since it 
will be much faster than the first, however it is still not the fastest since we would have to sort the array then iterate through it. 
This would create a time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(1).

3. Create a HashSet or unordered_set and add each element from the array to the set after checking if the set already contains that element. 
This is the fastest solution since we only have to iterate through our array once, however we sacrifice memory. This would create a time 
complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.
